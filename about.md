I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University Department of Linguistics</a>. 

My primary research interests lie in morphology and its interfaces with phonology and syntax. More specifically,

* morphologically conditioned consonant epenthesis 
* characterization of morphological processes as logical transductions 
* morphophonological vowel fronting in Serbo-Croatian

I am also a part of the <a href="andrija-petrovic.github.io/images/Screen Shot 2020-11-11 at 7.52.48 PM.png">Epenthesis research group</a> led by <a href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/lori.repetti/">Lori Repetti</a>.

In addition, I have worked on the stress system of Kuikuro (Cariban) with <a href="https://becker.phonologist.org">Michael Becker</a>.
